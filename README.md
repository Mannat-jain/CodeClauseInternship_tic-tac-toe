🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe Game with AI

🧠 Powered by Python + Minimax Algorithm + Tkinter GUI

This is a classic implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game with an AI opponent, built using Python’s Tkinter library for the graphical user interface and the Minimax algorithm for AI decision-making. It allows a human to play against a strategic, unbeatable AI. The game is simple, visually clean, and interactive.

📌 Features

Interactive GUI designed with Tkinter

AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm

Randomness can be optionally added to make the AI slightly less perfect

“Play Again” button to restart the game

Pop-up alert announcing the winner or a draw

User-friendly layout and clear board interactions

🧠 What is Minimax?

The Minimax algorithm is a classic decision rule used in two-player turn-based games. It simulates all possible outcomes assuming the opponent plays optimally, and selects the move that maximizes its own chance of winning. In this project, the AI uses Minimax to plan ahead and choose the best move every time.

(You can also add randomness to Minimax output to make the AI feel more human and beatable.)
